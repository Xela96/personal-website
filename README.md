# [wip] personal-website

A simple personal website to display my skills and experience as a software developer. This website will also be utilised as a basis to build and test an automated test library using PlayWright.

## How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Jinja2

Using the Flask web development framework in Python, this website was built with two main pages:
- Index/Homepage
- Projects

The homepage gives some basic details about myself and my professional experience. My CV is also downloadable from here.  
A contact me form is used for anyone who would like to contact me, which uses FlaskForms with minimum and maximum restrictions among others to validate the content within the textboxes.  
A Gmail server is used for me to receive the message as well as the contact details in my email.

The Projects page displays some projects I have worked on in my personal and professional career, with links to the source code where possible. AJAX is used for a reactive search function as well as a filter by technologies button.

Bootstrap is used throughout the website for a clean and consistent style to the website.
